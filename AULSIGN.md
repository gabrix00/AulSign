## **Overview**

* **Handle low-resource languages** in LLM training data.
* Operate in **data-scarce environments**.
* Translate between text and **Formal SignWriting (FSW)**, or vice versa.
* **Provide explainability**, detailing the steps taken by the model during translation.

---

## **Key Features**

* **Bidirectional translation:** Supports translation in both directions between text and FSW.
* **Data-scarcity handling:** Designed for sign languages with limited datasets.
* **Explainability:** Offers transparent insights into the model's internal processes during translation.
* **Extensibility:** Easily adaptable to new datasets and languages.

---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

* **No training required:** The model is ready to use.
* Recommended GPU: Necessary for running LLMs efficiently.
* Alternatively, you can use third-party inference services like **Openai Api** or similar.
* Python 3.9 or higher.
* Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`).

### **Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabrix00/aulsign.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the model:

   Run the script to generate all required files from scratch:

   ```bash
   python main_scripts/pipeline.py
   ```
4. Replicate the experiments:

   ```bash
   python aulsign.py --mode text2sign setup --full
   ```

   also setup `filtered` and `filtered_01` are available
5. Evaluate results

```bash
result/get_results_pipeline.py path --"result/text2sign_2024_12_06_12_17/result_2024_12_06_12_17.csv"
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Quick Example**

Run a simple translation command:

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --sentence_input "This is a new ASL translator" 
```

### **Available Modes**

* **`text2sign`**: Translate from text to Formal SignWriting.

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --input "Hello!"
```

* **`sign2text`**: Translate from Formal SignWriting to text.

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode sign2text --input "<FSW_code>"
```

---

## **Translation Process Explainability**

**AulSign** not only delivers accurate translations but also makes the process **explainable**. Here's how it works:

1. **Input analysis:**

   * In `text2sign` mode, the model segments the input text into semantic units.
   * In `sign2text` mode, the model decodes FSW symbols into intermediate representations.
2. **Representation matching:** A similarity-based metric aligns meanings between text and FSW using embeddings.
3. **Translation generation:** Each step is documented, enabling users to understand how the translation was produced.

**Example of explainable output:**
