# AulSign: Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation üåç

**AulSign** is a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with few-shot learning and sample selection techniques to bridge the gap between natural languages and sign languages.

## **Overview** üîç

* **Handle low-resource languages** in LLM training data.
* Operate in **data-scarce environments**.
* Translate between text and **Formal SignWriting (FSW)**, or vice versa.
* **Provide explainability**, detailing the steps taken by the model during translation.

---

## **Key Features** ‚ú®

* **Bidirectional translation:** Supports translation in both directions between text and FSW.
* **Data-scarcity handling:** Designed for sign languages with limited datasets.
* **Explainability:** Offers transparent insights into the model's internal processes during translation.
* **Extensibility:** Easily adaptable to new datasets and languages.

---

## **Installation** üõ†Ô∏è

### **Prerequisites** ‚öôÔ∏è

* **No training required:** The model is ready to use.
* Recommended GPU: Necessary for running LLMs efficiently.
* Alternatively, you can use third-party inference services like **OpenAI API** or similar.
* Python 3.9 or higher.
* Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`).
* **Environment Variables:**
  To use the `aulsign.py` script with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, make sure to export your OpenAI credentials in your terminal session:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
  export OPENAI_ORGANIZATION="YOUR_ORG_ID"
  export OPENAI_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  ```

### **Instructions** üìú

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabrix00/aulsign.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the model:
   Run the script to generate all required files from scratch:

   ```bash
   python data/main_scripts/pipeline.py
   ```
4. Replicating the Experiments
   To replicate the experiments with the full dataset, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --setup full
   ```

   Additionally, you can replicate the experiments with reduced datasets for different data scarcity scenarios:

   * **Filtered Dataset (2301 training samples):**

   ```bash
   python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --setup filtered
   ```

   * **Highly Filtered Dataset (115 training samples):**

   ```bash
   python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --setup filtered_01
   ```
5. Evaluate AulSign results:
   From **text2sign** use the following command:
   ```bash
   python result/get_results_pipeline_text2sign.py --result result/text2sign_{current_datetime}/result_{current_datetime}.csv
   ```
   From **sign2text** use the following command:
   ```bash
   python result/get_results_pipeline_sign2text.py --result result/sign2text_{current_datetime}/result_{current_datetime}.csv
   ```
6. Evaluate competitor results:
   ```bash
   python jiang_results_text2sign/get_results_pipeline.py --result jiang_results_text2sign/{folder_name}/predictions.csv
   ```



### **Quick Example** ‚ö°

Run a simple translation command:

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --input "This is a new ASL translator" 
```

### **Available Modes** üîÑ

* **`text2sign`**: Translate from text to Formal SignWriting.

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode text2sign --input "<input_sentence>" 
```

* **`sign2text`**: Translate from Formal SignWriting to text.

```bash
python aulsign.py --mode sign2text --input "<FSW_code>"
```

## **Translation Process Explainability** üß†

**AulSign** not only delivers accurate translations but also makes the process **explainable**. Here's how it works:

1. **Input analysis:**
   * In `text2sign` mode, the model segments the input text into semantic units.
   * In `sign2text` mode, the model decodes FSW symbols into intermediate representations.
2. **Representation matching:** A similarity-based metric aligns meanings between text and FSW using embeddings.
3. **Translation generation:** Each step is documented, enabling users to understand how the translation was produced.

**Example of explainable output:**
